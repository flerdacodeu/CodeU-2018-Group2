# Group 2 repository

This repository is where all members of group 2 will submit
their assignments.

A directory for each group member and assignment should already be
present: please submit your assignments within the corresponding
directories.

Remember to create a branch named `<username>-<assingment#>` instead
of submitting to the `master` branch and make a pull request to
`master` when you are ready to submit.
